    <p>"To have the first game of a European Championship in our own country at one of the most historic, iconic Premier</p>
<p>League grounds, I think it’s a massive statement from the FA in terms of the way that they’ve organised</p>
<p>tournament," England manager Phil Neville told UEFA.com.</p>


<p>"To play games at Wembley is what my players have dreamt about; to play in front of a packed Wembley Stadium, </p>
   <p> a packed Old Trafford, a packed Southampton, it’s really bucket list-type dreams that they’ve had."</p>
